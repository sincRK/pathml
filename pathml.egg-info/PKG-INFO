PathML: a Python library for deep learning on whole-slide images
=====
[PathML](https://github.com/markowetzlab/pathml) is a Python library for performing deep learning image analysis on whole-slide images (WSIs), including deep tissue, artefact, and background filtering, tile extraction, model inference, model evaluation and more.

Please see our [tutorial repository](https://github.com/markowetzlab/pathml-tutorial) to learn how to use `PathML` on an example problem from start to finish.

Installing PathML and its depedencies
----
Install PathML by cloning its repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/markowetzlab/pathml
```

PathML is best run inside an Anaconda environment. Once you have [installed Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install), you can create `pathml-env`, a conda environment containing all of PathML's dependencies, then activate that environment. Make sure to adjust the path to your local path to the pathml repository:
```
conda env create -f /path/to/pathml/pathml-environment.yml
conda activate pathml-env
```
Note that `pathml-environment.yml` installs Python version 3.7, PyTorch version 1.4, Torchvision version 0.5, and CUDA version 10.0. Stable versions above these should also work as long as the versions are cross-compatible. Be sure that the CUDA version matches the version installed on your GPU; if not, either update your GPU's CUDA or change the `cudatoolkit` line of `pathml-environment.yml` to match your GPU's version before creating `pathml-env`.

Some users have run into an error message saying that something from libvips is missing when `PathML` tries to import pyvips. This is because on some operating systems, the pip install of pyvips performed in the ```conda env create``` command leads to a flawed pyvips build. To solve this issue, also install pyvips using conda in `pathml-env`:
```
conda install -c conda-forge pyvips
```

For users who don't wish to use conda, `PathML` can also be installed via pip. To do so, navigate to to the `pathml` directory containing `setup.py`, and run the following command:
```
pip install -e .
```
